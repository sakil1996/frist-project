        <p>The coronavirus pandemic has had a huge impact on the way we buy things, with all UK supermarkets introducing new shopping rules and restrictions on a regular basis.
    
            Whether you shop at Tesco, Asda, Aldi, Sainsbury's or any major supermarket, you could be denied entry if you don't adhere to the rules, so it's important you understand the requirements before you head out. 
            
            From forcing limits on the number of shoppers to banning entry to those who donâ€™t wear a face mask (unless exempt), we look at the latest rules being enforced at each major supermarket, which we've listed in alphabetical order below.</p>
